    "Answer- Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by creating multiple trees from different random subsets of the training data. Since each tree is trained on a different subset, they may capture different patterns and noise in the data. When making predictions, bagging averages the predictions from all the trees, which helps to smooth out individual tree predictions and reduce the variance, thus mitigating overfitting."

    "Increased complexity: Using diverse base learners may lead to a more complex ensemble, which could make interpretation and implementation more challenging.\n",

    "Answer- The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging. Generally, using more complex base learners (e.g., deep decision trees) increases the variance but decreases the bias of the ensemble. Conversely, using simpler base learners (e.g., shallow decision trees) decreases the variance but increases the bias. The tradeoff depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the modeling task."

    "Answer-Yes, bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In both cases, bagging involves training multiple base models on different subsets of the training data and then aggregating their predictions. The main difference lies in how predictions are aggregated:\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification tasks, bagging typically aggregates predictions by majority voting among the base models.\n",
    "For regression tasks, bagging typically aggregates predictions by averaging the outputs of the base models."

   "source": [
    "Answer-The ensemble size in bagging refers to the number of base models included in the ensemble. Generally, increasing the ensemble size leads to better performance up to a certain point. After reaching a certain threshold, adding more models may not significantly improve performance and may only increase computational overhead. The optimal ensemble size depends on factors such as the complexity of the data and the base learner used."
